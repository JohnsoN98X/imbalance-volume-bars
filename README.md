# üìä Imbalance Volume Bars (IVB) ‚Äì Python Implementation

## üìò Project Description

This project provides a practical implementation of the Imbalance Volume Bars (IVB) method, originally introduced in *Advances in Financial Machine Learning* by Marcos L√≥pez de Prado.

One key distinction from L√≥pez de Prado‚Äôs original formulation is that this version **does not use the exponentially weighted average of bar lengths** to estimate the imbalance threshold.  
Instead, the threshold for forming a new bar is based purely on a **probabilistic exponential smoothing** of the absolute imbalance volume $\theta_t$.

### The project includes:

- A single Python class for IVB bar construction (`src/`)
- A Jupyter notebook demonstrating usage and a full comparative statistical analysis (`notebooks/Application Example`)
- A Jupyter notebook demonstrating the performance improvement of XGBoost with IVB sampling (`notebooks/XGB Regression Example.ipynb`)


> **Note**: All results and analysis are based on a single financial time series and a fixed decay factor of $\alpha = 0.9$.  
> Explanations aim to showcase analytical approaches to interpreting sampling behavior ‚Äî not to generalize across all assets.

## üìê Mathematical Formulation ‚Äì Imbalance Volume Bars (IVB)

At each time step *t*, the following calculations are performed:

---

### 1. Directional Sign

Œ≤‚Çú = +1‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉif‚ÄÉP‚Çú ‚àí P‚Çú‚Çã‚ÇÅ > 0  
Œ≤‚Çú = ‚àí1‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉotherwise

Where *P‚Çú* is the closing price at time *t*.

---

### 2. Volume Imbalance

Œ∏‚Çú = Œ≤‚Çú √ó V‚Çú

Where *V‚Çú* is the traded volume. Œ∏‚Çú captures signed trade pressure.

---

### 3. Cumulative Imbalance

Œò‚Çú = Œ£‚Çç·µ¢‚Çå‚Çõ‚Çé‚ÅΩ·µó‚Åæ Œ∏·µ¢

Where *s* marks the start of the current bar.

---

### 4. Adaptive Threshold (Exponential Smoothing)

Œµ‚Çú = Œ± √ó |Œ∏‚Çú| + (1 ‚àí Œ±) √ó Œµ‚Çú‚Çã‚ÇÅ

Where:  
- *Œ±* ‚àà (0, 1) is the smoothing parameter  
- *Œµ‚Çú* is the adaptive imbalance threshold

---

### 5. Bar Formation Condition

A new bar is formed when:  
‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ|Œò‚Çú| > Œµ‚Çú

Once this is true:  
- An OHLCV bar is created for [s, t]  
- Œò‚Çú is reset  
- Next bar starts from t+1


---

### üìä Each Completed Bar Contains:
- **Open**: $P_s$
- **High**: $\max \{P_s, ..., P_t\}$
- **Low**: $\min \{P_s, ..., P_t\}$
- **Close**: $P_t$
- **Volume**: $\sum_{i=s}^{t} V_i$

## üöÄ Getting Started

### üîß Requirements

| Purpose            | Libraries Needed                                      |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Running the class  | `pandas`, `numpy`                                     |
| Running the notebook | `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `statsmodels`, `scipy` |

> To install all dependencies (for the notebook), run:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn statsmodels scipy
```

---

## üîç Usage Notes

- Input must be a `pandas.DataFrame` with columns: `['open', 'high', 'low', 'close', 'volume']`
- Output is a resampled OHLCV DataFrame indexed by Datetime
- Core logic is optimized using NumPy for high-frequency scalability

## üî¨ Applied Experiment ‚Äì Model Performance with IVB

To empirically assess the impact of IVB sampling on model accuracy, this project includes a controlled regression experiment using `XGBoostRegressor`.  
The notebook demonstrates how data sampled using Imbalance Volume Bars improves predictive performance over time-based sampling.

### üß™ Setup:
- Model: `XGBoostRegressor` with Bollinger Bands and ATR features.
- Tuning: `optuna`, with a time limit of 300 seconds per optimization.
- Metrics: R¬≤, MSE, and cross-validation consistency.

## üì° Data Source & Usage

The dataset was retrieved using the `ib_insync` library connected to Interactive Brokers (IB).  
Due to IB‚Äôs licensing policy, **raw market data is excluded** from this repository.

To reproduce results:
- Acquire your own OHLCV data (from public APIs or CSVs)
- Only timestamped OHLCV values are required ‚Äî no proprietary metadata.
